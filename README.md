### **Golang playground**

This repo will be used with the purposed of getting more and more familiar with Go programming language.

#### Project Tree

This repo will not only accomodate simple exercises of golang, with different level of difficulty, but also minor projects. <br>
Taking this into account, the project will be divided into two different strands:<br>
- `/first-steps`: Unitary execises with multiple complexity levels will be splitted by subject; 
- `/projects`: Projects that will be developed with Golang and preferably following a TDD approach.
